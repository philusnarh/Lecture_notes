ICT: Information and Communications Technology
==============================================


**Course Description**
The ICT course is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python >= 3.5 programming language.



**Goals**

- Provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
- Help students feel confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
- Help students to have basic understanding in data science.
- Position students so that they can compete for research projects and excel in subjects with programming components.
